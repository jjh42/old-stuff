This is patch to add support for showing the amount of fetching installing
a package is going to take. See http://bif.sourceforge.net/patches.php

From my submission to gentoo:

Hi, 
 
I download stuff over a 56K modem so it is of interest to me to about how much 
downloading a package is going to require. 
This modification consists of three things. 
output.py.diff: Addes humansize function. 
portage.py.diff: Adds 2 more ebuild functions. 
                 "fetchsize". This instead of fetching the files will say 
                 how much fetching is left. Ie 6.4 MB or 1.3K etc. It gets 
                this info by parsing the digest files and checking if the 
                files to be downloaded already exist. If they do it subtracts 
                the amount already there for the size. Ie if u have downloaded 
                3 MB of an 8MB file it will tell you only 5MB remaining. 
                Also adds "pfetchsize". This is a version of fetchsize that is 
                used by portage. Rather than printing the amount to be 
                downloaded it exits with a return value of that amount. 
emerge.diff:    Changes emerge so that when doing "--pretend" it prints 
                by each package the size (it gets this size by using ebuild 
                pfetchsize). 
                And the bottum of the list it prints a total. 
 
This is my first time really using python. Let me know if you want anything 
fixed up or anything like that.
