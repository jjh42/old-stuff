emergesize:		This directory contains some patches for emerge the package
			manager used by Gentoo Linux (http://www.gentoo.org). These
			patches add support for querying the size of a package. See
			the README in the directory for more info.

cervisia.patch:		This is a minor patch against cervisia version 1.5rich1 from kdesdk sources
			(http://developers.kde.org). This patch makes the ChangeLog dialog
			in cervisia non-modal. I found the modal dialog real annoying because I
			was often wanting to do diffs with files against the repository so I could
			check what changes I had done. I hav submitted the patch.
